# Life-Course Comorbidity Analysis in Kidney Stone Disease (KSD)

This repository contains code and visualizations for a phenome-wide, age-stratified analysis of comorbidity burden in individuals with kidney stone disease (KSD), using electronic health record (EHR) data. The methods focus on both **odds ratio-based enrichment analysis** and **absolute risk difference (ARD) visualizations** to uncover systemic risk patterns across the lifespan.
